# OpenVINO_POC
This repo contains POC works including generalized AI pipelines and function features for scaling which are based on OpenVINO API and OpenVINO GenAI API. There includes new model /pipeline enabling samples; fork of OpenVINO empowered and integrated 3rd part tools.

## Project 1: RAG serving pipeline based on OpenVINO GenAI
The OpenVINO GenAI Server(OGS) is a client-server based pipeline framework for generative AI and multimodal models. It demostrates the pure C++ RAG samples of LLM & retrival with vectorDB. The repo also provides the sample of image search with CLIP model and vectorDB.

<summary><b>Why use OpenVINO GenAI Server (OGS)? </b></summary>
<li>Most <b>light-weighted</b> serving solution without docker container;</li> 
<li>Pure <b>C++ interface</b> for edge/client application deployment;</li>
<li>Pure OpenVINO backend with <b>minimum package size</b>;</li>
<li><b>Cross Hardware platform</b> deployment among Intel CPU/iGPU/dGPU/NPU;</li>

## Project 2: Dynamic LoRA
There was an exploration of dynamic & multiple LoRA enabling of SD based on OpenVINO [https://github.com/FionaZZ92/OpenVINO_sample/tree/master/SD_controlnet](https://github.com/FionaZZ92/OpenVINO_sample/tree/master/SD_controlnet) which has been inspired to be sample of OpenVINO GenAI [https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/tree/releases/2024/4/image_generation/lcm_dreamshaper_v7/cpp](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/tree/releases/2024/4/image_generation/lcm_dreamshaper_v7/cpp). Finally production into the using friendly feature since OpenVINO GenAI 2024.5.

To expand the dynamisim of LoRA enabling on LLM, the other LoRA enrichment exploration work moving forward: [https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/pull/1852](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/pull/1852). The goal of dynamic LoRA requires:
1. Allow user to load 1-N LoRA adpaters for LLM, and they can switch the LoRA runtimely. 
2. The switch cost no require to re-compile the model. The switch cost no require to have larger memory consumption if the rank is same.
3. For GPU device inference solution, must remove the backup LoRA on the system heap memory when the device buffer been occupied. 

## Project 3: AI Speech
This projects contains OV enabled ASR and TTS models, the C++ pipeline ready to be direct scaling. And customized modification for effective tuning in application.

## Project 4: Ollama-OV(not public yet)
The Ollama-OV replace the llama.cpp but using OpenVINO GenAI as backend inference engine to accelerate inference performance on Intel XPU platform.
